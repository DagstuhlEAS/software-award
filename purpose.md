# Purpose
A fundamental problem working with scientists (in particular physics and 
astronomy were mentioned), a huge amount of the work is the software, but only 
the papers count. The process then becomes “I write the software and then I 
write a paper as well.” We need a culture change to make the community aware 
that scientific software contains intellectual content and scientific 
innovation. 

One or more sub-national, national, or international technical societies should give out a software award. 
A private funder could back this andy may be able to partner with domain-science technical societies for some small awards. 
Ideally, such a private funder were to provide seed funding for an endowment for such an award. 


## Purpose?
- Recognize someone previously under-recognized for their contributions to research (science, engineering, humanities, etc.) via software.  (i.e., project-based nominations?)

## Who would give out the awards?
- Professional societies in various domains? (e.g., ACM SIGCHI, ANS, ASME, APS, AIBS, AIS, AAS, IEEE CS: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Scientific_societies)
- A unified larger award that goes across domains?
- In either case, the Dagstuhl group could create a template that could be used by the awarder (a Github repo that could be forked and customized?)
- National Academies?  (Hmmm, perhaps this is a good, high-level, approach.)

## Individuals or groups?
- Individuals, it seems.

## How often?
- Annual (ie a standing/annual award, not a one-off award)
## How to judge?
- Impacts enabling research via software
- open source
- From packet submitted during nomination
- Could be contributions from an individual across many organizations 
- Software that other scholars use (e.g., distinct from “best demo” awards such as https://nips.cc/Conferences/2015/Awards and http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~taoyf/sigmod10bd.html )
- Similar to https://www.insna.org/awards_richard.html? Or not a “lifetime achievement” award?

## Who will judge?
- Domain experts in your field who are members of the honors/awards committee  in your national society?
- General software experts

## How much? 
- $2000-$2500 unrestricted funds

## What else is needed?
- Administrator fees?
- Travel expenses for judges?
- Combine the above as misc. expenses associated with selecting and awarding the prize. Perhaps this would be to defray expenses of a software knowledgeable person who wouldn’t otherwise be attending the meetings where the prizes were decided.
